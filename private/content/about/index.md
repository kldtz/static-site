I am a software developer and computational linguist. As such I'm interested in language(s), algorithms and machine learning. In the past I devoloped software at [Empolis](https://www.empolis.com/en) in Berlin and did research on clinical NLP in the [SMITH](https://www.smith.care/?lang=en) project at Jena University. Currently, I'm working at [DOCYET](https://www.docyet.com), a digital health startup based in Leipzig.
